avgVideo takes a video file on the command line, calculates the average
RGB color value of each frame and then outputs it to both a GL window
and to an OLA lighting system running locally on the machine.

The code is intended to be used inside of an openFrameworks source tree.
Drop this directory in to apps/myApps inside openFrameworks, run make
and you should be good to go.

If the build can't find libopenFrameworks.a, change to
libs/openFrameworksCompiled/project/linux in the root of the openFrameworks
source tree and run make from there.
